🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS) Python Application- This project is a lightweight Text-to-Speech (TTS) application built in Python, capable of converting text input into human-like speech. It includes utilities for testing, rendering outputs, and generating audio files (.wav) through various TTS implementations.

check the audio file output in file - direct_test.wav , final.wav , output.wav after clicking on View raw.

📁 Project Structure- tts_app.py – Main application logic to handle text-to-speech conversion.

test_tts.py – Unit tests or sample scripts to test the core functionality.

direct_tts.py – An alternate or simplified method for direct TTS conversion.

requirements.txt – Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.

render.yaml – Configuration or preset options for the rendering engine or TTS settings.

README.md – Project documentation and usage instructions.

direct_test.wav, output.wav, final.wav – Sample output audio files generated by the TTS engine.

Dockerfile – Enables containerized deployment using Docker for easy setup and scalability.

.gitignore – Specifies files to be excluded from version control.

LICENSE – License details for usage and distribution.

🔧 Features- Convert custom text input into .wav audio files.

Easy testing and debugging using sample scripts.

Docker support for deployment on any platform.

Configurable rendering via render.yaml.

🚀 Quick Start-

pip install -r requirements.txt , python tts_app.py

You can also test directly using:-

python direct_tts.py

📦 Docker Support- Build and run the app using Docker:-
